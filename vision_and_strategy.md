# Vision & Strategy: Entropy v2.0 (The Second Brain)

Entropy is evolving from a task manager into a cognitive partner. To make this vision manageable for development, the documentation has been split into dedicated modules:

### 1. [Platform Overview](file:///Users/akshit2434/github/productivity-engine/docs/00_overview.md)
*Philosophy, current feature set, and critical developer guidelines (pnpm, testing protocols, styling).*

### 2. [Agent Design](file:///Users/akshit2434/github/productivity-engine/docs/01_agent_design.md)
*The Assistant's personality, system prompt blueprint, tool catalog, and memory retrieval logic.*

### 3. [Implementation Phases](file:///Users/akshit2434/github/productivity-engine/docs/02_phases.md)
*Step-by-step roadmap divided into 5 testable phases. Includes database migrations and user testing criteria.*
