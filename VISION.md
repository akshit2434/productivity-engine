# The Entropy Philosophy: Cognitive Clarity & Focused Execution

**Project Status:** Active Alpha  
**Concept:** Probabilistic Scheduling & Dynamic Context

## 1. The Core Vision
In an era of infinite distraction, the greatest luxury is **focus**. 

Entropy UI (Dynamic Context Engine) isn't a to-do list; it's a **cognitive filter**. It treats potential work as living entities that compete for your attention. By modeling work as "Entropy" (the inevitable decay of neglected priorities), the system ensures that nothing critical slips through the cracks while hiding the clutter that doesn't matter *now*.

## 2. Aesthetic: High-Performance Minimalism
We have moved away from "Industrial Zen" / Neon aesthetics toward a **High-Performance Minimalism**.
- **Vibe:** Swiss Design meets Modern IDE. Slate, Charcoal, and targeted Primary accents.
- **Copy:** Professional and functional. We avoid "gaming" or "pilot cockpit" roleplay (e.g., no "Bot IDs" or "System Status"). We use clear, descriptive labels.
- **Micro-Interactions:** Smooth, intentional transitions that provide feedback without distraction.
- **Typography:** Inter for readability, JetBrains Mono for data-dense numeric tracking.

## 3. Key Concepts

### Projects as Value Centers
Each project is a "Boat" in your fleet, requiring maintenance:
- **Project Tier:** Prioritization from 1 (Most Urgent) to 4 (Maintenance).
- **Decay Threshold:** The heartbeat of the system. Defines how often a project needs attention.
- **Multi-KPI Tracking:** Projects aren't just names; they are driven by metrics. One or more KPIs track the real-world impact.

### The Syllabus (The "Execution" Algorithm)
The home screen is a **Syllabus**—a curated list of what to execute *next*.
`Score = (Tier Weight) × (Days Since Last Touch / Decay Threshold) × (Context Multiplier)`
- Filters by **Time Available** (15m, 30m, 1h, 2h+).
- Adapts to **Energy Mode** (Creative, Grind, Shallow).

## 4. The Integrated AI Workflow
The future of productivity is a conversation.
- **Natural Language Parsing**: "Remind me every 15 days" is understood as a custom recurrence.
- **Audio Dumps**: Capture raw thoughts via voice; the engine handles the extraction.
- **Context Chat**: Interact with your backlog via a dedicated AI hub.
