# The Entropy Philosophy: Precision Over Clutter

**Project Status:** Active Alpha  
**Concept:** Probabilistic Scheduling & Context-Aware Execution

## 1. The Core Vision
The world doesn't need another to-do list. It needs an **execution engine**. 

Most productivity apps fail because they treat all tasks as static items on a list. **Entropy UI** (Dynamic Context Engine) treats tasks as living entities that decay over time. If you ignore a project, its "Entropy" (Urgency) increases. If you touch it, its health is rejuvenated.

This app is designed for builders, founders, and engineers who manage multiple "Boats" (Projects) and need a cockpit that helps them decide what to do *next*, based on their current energy, time available, and project health.

## 2. The "Industrial Zen" Aesthetic
We prioritize **Information Density** over whitespace.
- **Vibe:** Code Editor meets Bloomberg Terminal meets Pilot's Cockpit.
- **Typography:** Sans-serif for reading, Monospace for data.
- **Color:** Semantic only. Gold is Critical, Blue is Flow, Red is Decay.

## 3. Key Concepts

### Projects as "Boats"
Each project is an independent unit with its own:
- **Project Tier:** 1 (Mission Critical) to 4 (Icebox).
- **Decay Threshold:** How many days can pass before the project starts "rusting"?
- **KPI:** A "North Star" numeric metric that proves progress.

### The Syllabus (The "What Next" Algorithm)
The home screen isn't a list; it's a **Probabilistic Syllabus**. 
`Score = (Tier Weight) × (Days Since Last Touch / Decay Threshold) × (Context Multiplier)`
- The system *recommends* 3-5 tasks.
- If you have 15 minutes, it shows 15-minute tasks.
- if you're in "Low Energy" mode, it hides the "Grind" tasks.

## 4. The Power User Workflow
1. **Quick Capture:** Dump raw thoughts via AI.
2. **Review:** Weekly data-driven audit of where time actually went.
3. **Execution:** Use the Syllabus. Don't think about what's next. Just execute.
